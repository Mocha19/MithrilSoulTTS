This is currently in a somewhat less than working state. 
I'ved rebuilt from scratch and am currently on version 1.5
the main has been stripped down to bare bones, and the settings are now all in seperate files.
I've accidentally destroyeds the previous working model, but have put more work into this version. 

I'll include hte file of the most recently working versions in OLD CODE


Some various settings:

1. General Settings (Preferences Tab)
Auto-Play TTS:
Toggle Switch: An on/off toggle that determines whether TTS audio should play automatically after text submission.
Implementation Detail: When turned off, the user will need to press the "Listen" or "Speak" button to hear the audio. When turned on, the Listen and speak buttons are replaced by a single large block that says AutoSpeak activated
Volume Presets:
Custom Sliders: Two volume sliders for independent control of speakers and mic output. Sliders can save user-defined presets.
Startup Behavior:
Launch at Startup Checkbox: Allows the app to start with the system.
Minimize to System Tray Checkbox: If enabled, closing the app minimizes it to the tray rather than quitting.
Theme and Appearance:
Theme Toggle: A toggle for Dark Mode/Light Mode.
Custom Color Scheme: Dropdown to select from predefined color themes or a color picker for users to create their own.
Font Size: Slider for adjusting font sizes globally within the app, including text inputs and outputs.

2. Audio Preferences (Preferences Tab)
Default Voice Selection:
Voice Selector Dropdown: A dropdown that lists all available voices, such as Nova and other OpenAI voices. Users can set the default voice used across all profiles.
Playback Devices:
Device Selector: Dropdowns for both Speakers and Microphone Input, allowing the user to choose their preferred playback and input devices.
Mic Sensitivity:
Sensitivity Slider: Slider that adjusts mic sensitivity when audio is routed through a virtual microphone.
Noise Suppression and Echo Cancellation:
Toggle Switches: Separate toggles for enabling/disabling noise suppression and echo cancellation. Helps ensure clear audio when using the mic in voice apps like Discord.

3. Profile-Specific Preferences (Profiles Tab)
Auto-Switch Profile Based on Context:
Context Rules: A settings area where users can define keywords or conditions that trigger automatic profile switching. For example, if a command is combat-related, the app might switch to a Warrior profile.
Recent Profile Memory:
Memory Toggle: Checkbox to enable or disable the feature where the app remembers the last active profile used and reloads it on startup.
Input Auto-Correction:
Auto-Correct Toggle: Option to automatically suggest or apply corrections to input before sending it to the language model. This improves the accuracy and style of commands entered.

4. User Experience Preferences (Preferences Tab)
Multi-Profile Responses:
Enable/Disable Multi-Profile Switching: Toggle that enables switching between multiple profiles during long dialogues, allowing different profiles to respond based on the type of input.
Profile-Switching Rules: Define rules for when to switch profiles automatically (similar to Auto-Switch Profile Based on Context).
Speech Command Integration (Future Feature):
Voice Command Toggle: Toggle to enable/disable speech commands.
Command Customization: Settings to define custom commands (e.g., “Next profile”, “Replay last TTS”).

5. Notification Preferences (Preferences Tab)
Discord Integration Options:
Audio Notification Toggle: Toggle sound effects for system actions like profile switching, text submission, or TTS completion.
Volume Control for Notifications: Separate volume slider for adjusting notification sound levels.
Visual Alerts:
Flash Screen/Tray Icon: Checkbox to flash the screen or system tray icon when the app requires user attention.
Pop-up Notifications:
Enable Pop-ups: Checkbox to show small pop-up notifications when profiles change or when TTS is completed (particularly useful when minimized).
Error and Warning Alerts:
Error Display Settings: Option to choose how errors and warnings are displayed (e.g., visual pop-ups, sounds, or both).

6. Backup and Sync Preferences (Preferences Tab) <USE GITHUB FOR CLOUD>
Profile Backup and Sync:
Cloud Sync Toggle: Enable/Disable automatic cloud syncing of profiles and settings. Offers backup at regular intervals (daily, weekly, monthly).

Import/Export Settings:
Import/Export Button: Buttons to export profiles/settings as files that can be shared with other users or imported into another instance of Charisma Echo.

7. Advanced Preferences (Preferences Tab)
Developer Mode:
Enable Developer Mode: A hidden option (like pressing a certain key combo) that unlocks advanced settings such as logging tools, debugging information, and deeper customization of the TTS and profile system.
Logging and Analytics:
Toggle Logging: Option to save logs of user inputs and TTS outputs for later review.
Analytics Reporting: Option to report performance metrics like TTS speed and language model accuracy, useful for improving the app.

8. Profile-Specific Settings (Profiles Tab)
Voice Speed and Pitch Adjustments:
Speed and Pitch Sliders: Sliders for adjusting the speed (Slow, Normal, Fast) and pitch (Low, Normal, High) of the TTS voice, allowing users to customize the sound of their characters.
Voice Effects:
Voice Effects Menu: Dropdown menu or toggle switches for adding sound effects like echo, reverb, or filters that simulate different environments (e.g., talking in a cave, robotic voice).
Tie to Profiles: The effects can be tied to specific profiles, making character voices more immersive.

Since you mentioned integrating with Discord, these features could be added:
Playback Through Discord: Automatically route the TTS audio through the Discord voice channel via a virtual microphone.
Discord Notification Integration: Show profile changes or status updates as a Discord message or status change.
Discord Command Input: Allow users to control Charisma Echo directly via Discord commands (e.g., "!tts command").
